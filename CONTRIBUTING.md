### Commit Messages

Commit messages should be verb based, using the following pattern:

type(scope): Short description...

**type** can be one of feat, fix, tests, chore, docs etc..

**scope** should immediately indicate the file, component or package involved in the commit (more detailed is better)

### Testing

Please update the tests to reflect your code changes. Pull requests will not be accepted if they are failing.

### Documentation

Please update the README.md files (root and services') accordingly so that there are no discrepancies between the API and the documentation.
